# Awesome ETL [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)
A curated list of notable ETL (extract, transform, load) frameworks, libraries and software.

The premise of this list: you don't need fancy, specialized ETL frameworks. Well-structured code using mainstream, well-supported libraries gets you surprisingly far and is easier to test, review, and version control than tools that make those things difficult. Tools here are selected for real-world adoption and staying power, not novelty.

Open source tools are strongly preferred. Proprietary or restrictively licensed tools are only included when they're mainstream enough to be genuinely hard to ignore. See CONTRIBUTING.md for full inclusion criteria.

## ETL Tools (GUI)
*Warning*: If you're already familiar with a scripting language, GUI ETL tools are not a good replacement for a well structured application written with a scripting language. These tools lack flexibility and are a good example of the ["inner-platform effect"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner-platform_effect). With a large project, you will most likely run into instances where "the tool doesn't do that" and end up implementing something hacky with a script run by the GUI ETL tool. Also, the GUI can conceal complexity and the files these tools generate are impossible to code review. However, the GUI and out-of-the-box functionality can make some tasks simpler, especially for people not comfortable with writing code.
